# Advanced JavaScript Assignment: Constructor Word Guess

### Overview

In this unit's assignment, I created a Word Guess command-line game using constructor functions.


## Here's how the app works:

* The application has three basic files:

* **Letter.js**: Contains a constructor, Letter. This constructor should be able to either display an underlying character or a blank placeholder, depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter.

* **Word.js**: Contains a constructor, Word that depends on the Letter constructor. This is used to create an object representing the current word the user is attempting to guess.

* **index.js**: The file containing the logic for the course of the game, which depends on `Word.js` and:

  * Randomly selects a word and uses the `Word` constructor to store it

  * Prompts the user for each guess and keeps track of the user's remaining

## App design notes:

* The completed game should be able to receive user input using the `inquirer` or `prompt` npm packages.

## Technologies used:

* JavaScript

* Node.js

* Inquirer NPM
